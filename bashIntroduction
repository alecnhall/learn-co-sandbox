Command Line Interface

CLI is a text based converstaion with the computer in which we type the commands for 

- viewing, handling, an dmanipulation files on your computer
- launching software
- working with devices like printers or networks

CLI prompts the user for a command, the user types it in, and then the computer runs the "sentence" that was typed in. It returns output, too (where appropriate).

CLI/Terminal Emulator/Shell

- Terminal is emulated on the computer
- Terminal handles the input and output of the while the shell works with the operating system and CPU
- Interpretation of commands in the terminal is handled by shell
- bash is a specific shell used by unix based OS (Mac OSX and Linux)
- "command-line" is roughly the same as shell, it's a style of interaction with the shell

You must have comfort with the command-line in order to be a successful programmer
